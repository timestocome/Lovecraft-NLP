# Lovecraft-NLP
Practice a bit of NLP using Lovecraft stories


Lovecraft stories are interesting in that out of 67 stories there are 23,868 unique vocabulary words (including punctation marks as words) and 8,611 ~ 36% occur only once.

Typically you'd drop these words but so much is lost that way. I'm going to see what can be done leaving them in the dataset
